# **The Night School**

## _The Beginning_

Hi! I'm Apple and I've just moved into the school hostel! Today will be my first night here and so far the day has been great! 
My neighbours and teacher-in-charge, Ms Sunny have all been very nice to me. I can't wait to start anew in my new home!
Everyone repeatedly warns me about not leaving my room after 10pm, I wonder why.

### _Discoveries_ 

Tick tock, the clock strikes 10 and I can't go out. 
I sit in my room looking out of the window at the night sky. Dark clouds swirl in the sky. 
Many questions form in my mind. _Why can't I go out? What could be so dangerous out there? This is a school! Shouldn't there not be anything happening at night? Shouldn't it be safe?_
I could no longer sit still. I put on my cute sunflower slippers and sneaked out of my room. When I reached the ground level, I slowly sneaked out of the hostel and into the school. Everything was pitch black, I could only smell the milo from the drink stall.  
First, I explored the senior high block and the canteen but I spotted nothing suspicious.
Second, I explored the Y3 and Y4 block but similarly, nothing was there.
As I walked towards the Y1 and Y2 block, I heard shouting coming from the third level. When I reached level 3, I crept towards the classroom. Turns out, the sounds were coming from the 1C classroom. The windows were open so any little movement could be seen. I knew I had to be careful.
I hid behind the big red back door. I took a peek and saw people in black robes who looked like they were fighting. When the leader, who could be differentiated by a big black hat, turned around, our eyes met and my jaw dropped...

#### _The Horrors_
The leader lifted her head to reveal her face, her all-too-familiar eyes meeting mine. Her round nose, full lips and round glasses. *__It was Ms Sunny.__* I rubbed my eyes and pinched myself, not believing how her kind self earlier in the day was just a disguise. 
She screamed in her high-pitched voice, "CATCH HER!" Her followers closed the door to find me behind it and they surrounded me. I was trapped, unable to escape.
My heart beat wildly in my chest, like it was going to burst anytime now. Her screeching voice pierced the air and shocked me greatly. I had no idea what was going to happen. They dragged me to their leader. Ms Sunny's devilish eyes glared at me and she said, "Now that you know my secret, you are done for. But just to satisfy your deadly curiosity, you may ask me three questions."

##### _Answers_
Since I already knew that I was done for, I decided to ask away. "What are you doing, Why are you doing this."
Ms Sunny answered with a devilish grin, "By day, I'm just a kind teacher-in-charge at the hostel. But by night, I run a school for ghosts. The people who caught you are my fellow human teachers. We all have an ability to see ghosts and communicate with them. You can't see but there are about 30 ghosts circling you right now. I founded this school to teach ghosts to communicate with humans who can't see them so they can communicate with their loved ones." I asked, "If what you're doing isn't bad, why are you doing this so secretly?" She sighed, "If I get found out, I won't be able to teach here anymore. That's why I have to make whoever who finds out about me at night keep quiet." 

###### _The End, or is it?_
Ms Sunny said. "Your three questions have been answered and now it's time for you to go." Just then, I saw a shadow of a human. I squinted my eyes and saw Mr Lee, my science teacher! He said, "Oh not this night school again." He grabbed my sunflower system and whispered to me, "Close your eyes." I quickly closed my eyes and saw a yellow glimmer, it was my sunflower slippers! Mr Lee activated the power of my sunflower slippers and it knocked everyone out, just in time for me to run... After I ran out of the classroom, Mr Lee explained, "I am the protector of the school at night and I, too, can see these ghosts. Now, forget everything." 

I opened my eyes to the daylight shining into my room. I was lying in my bed in the hostel, like nothing had happened. I was confused, was i not supposed to forget everything that had happened last night? Soon after, I heard a knock on the door. My hostel teacher-in-charge, Ms Sunny grinned and said, "Apple, you're late."
